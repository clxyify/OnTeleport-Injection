# OnTeleport-Injection

Automatically **rescans** Roblox due to a **game onTeleport event.**

If you don't know what a `teleport.inprogress` is, it's where the game decides you to **teleport** to another server. When you **teleport** to that new server, the injection still remains on the old server. In short words, your **exploit** will die if the game teleports you. **Well,** that problem is no longer a pain anymore.
